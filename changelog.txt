Affected: Menu (/tmp/roms_missing.menu) and report (missing_covers.txt).
Purpose: Improve clarity of output text.
Commit Message: "Use singular 'cover' for one missing cover and plural 'covers' for multiple in list_missing_covers."

Change Description (list_orphaned_files)

Updated list_orphaned_files to use "file" (singular) when one orphaned file is detected and "files" (plural) when multiple files are detected.
Affected: Menu (/tmp/roms_orphaned.menu) and report (orphaned_files.txt).
Purpose: Enhance output clarity with correct singular/plural terminology.
Commit Message: "Use singular 'file' for one orphaned file and plural 'files' for multiple in list_orphaned_files."

Change Description (statistics)

Updated View total ROMs per system in statistics function to use "ROM" (singular) when one ROM is detected and "ROMs" (plural) when multiple ROMs are detected.
Affected: Menu (/tmp/total_roms.menu).
Purpose: Improve clarity of output text by using correct singular/plural terminology.
Commit Message: "Use singular 'ROM' for one ROM and plural 'ROMs' for multiple in View total ROMs per system."

Change Description (analyze_disk_usage)

Updated analyze_disk_usage to suppress user-facing error messages when show_message fails to display system details or total disk usage, ensuring a seamless return to the system list menu without displaying errors.
Added cleanup of /tmp/minui-output before relaunching minui-list to prevent stale data issues.
Modified the system list menu (/tmp/disk_usage.menu) to show only the system name and total size on a single line, requiring the user to select a system to view detailed information (ROMs, Covers, Total size) instead of displaying all details in the list.
Optionally provided logic to stay in the system list menu on "BACK" press instead of returning to the parent menu.
Affected: Menu loop (/tmp/disk_usage.menu), log ($LOGS_PATH/Rom Inspector.txt), and user interface for system details display.
Purpose: Eliminate unwanted error messages, improve menu loop reliability, and simplify the system list by showing detailed information only on selection.
Commit Message: "Suppress error messages on show_message failure, ensure seamless system list menu reload, and display system details on selection instead of in the list in analyze_disk_usage."

Change Description (General)

Added CHD file format for PS1 as valid extension.
Affected: get_valid_extensions function.
Purpose: Support additional PlayStation ROM format.
Commit Message: "Add CHD file format for PlayStation in get_valid_extensions."

New function (check_rom_names)

Added new function check_rom_names to the main menu to verify if ROM names adhere to an expected format, excluding special characters (e.g., #, %, $, *, +, ?, =, &, |, <, >, !, @, square brackets) or multiple consecutive spaces.
Generates a report (rom_names_report.txt) listing ROMs with problematic names per system.
Provides an interactive menu to view problematic ROM names, with options to rename (to an automatic cleaned-up version) or delete them.
Uses "name" (singular) when one problematic name is detected and "names" (plural) when multiple names are detected in /tmp/rom_names.menu and rom_names_report.txt.
Affected: Main menu (/tmp/main_menu.menu), new menu (/tmp/rom_names.menu), new report (rom_names_report.txt), log ($LOGS_PATH/Rom Inspector.txt).
Purpose: Ensure ROM names follow a standard format for consistency and compatibility, with user-friendly options to address issues.
Commit Message: "Add check_roms_names function to verify ROM names, generate report, and provide rename/delete options with singular/plural terminology."

New function (Manage_zip_roms)

Added new function Manage_zip_roms to the main menu to scan ZIP ROMs, generate a report (zip_roms_report.txt), and provide options to decompress, delete, or skip ZIP files.
Updated Check_zip_roms to display loading screen (show_message) during decompression and deletion actions by removing fixed durations and synchronizing closure with kill $MESSAGE_PID.
Uses "file" (singular) for one ZIP file and "files" (plural) for multiple in menus (/tmp/systems_zip.menu, /tmp/roms_zip.menu) and report (zip_roms_report.txt).
Affected: Main menu (/tmp/main_menu.menu), new menus (/tmp/systems_zip.menu, /tmp/roms_zip.menu), new report (zip_roms_report.txt), log ($LOGS_PATH/Rom Inspector.txt).
Purpose: Enable management of ZIP ROMs with user-friendly options and improve UX by showing loading screen during actions.

V.0.4.1-beta :
Change Description (Manage_zip_roms)

Fixed syntax error at line 1296 in Manage_zip_roms function causing unexpected "}" (expecting "fi"). Replaced command groups (e.g., rm -f "$file" && { ... } || { ... }) with explicit if/else statements to improve clarity and ensure proper syntax. 
Validated all if statements have corresponding fi closures and removed potential stray braces. Simplified nested logic for decompression and deletion actions to reduce error likelihood. 
Affected: Manage_zip_roms function, log ($LOGS_PATH/Rom Inspector.txt), report (zip_roms_report.txt). 
Purpose: Resolve syntax error to ensure script runs without crashing and improve maintainability of the function. Commit Message: "Fix syntax error in Manage_zip_roms by replacing command groups with explicit if/else statements and ensuring proper if/fi pairing."
